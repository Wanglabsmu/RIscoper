"taken together, our data suggest that mir-155 may attenuate the expression of smad2 by directly targeting the 3'utr of smad2."
we showed that only the 8-mer site contributed to mir-155 repressing actions on the 3'utr of smad2; similar results were obtained in a recent study on mir-155 targeting smad2 in macrophages.
"in addition to the known target p27 and p57, we identify aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator messenger rna as a novel target of mir-221, which contributes to the pro-proliferative activity of mir-221."
"next, to investigate whether cell cycle regulators are affected by knockdown of arnt mrna, we determined the protein levels of the cdk inhibitors, p21 and p27."
"the mirna target analysis tool mirwalk 23 was used to screen validated targets of mir-27a,mir-181a and mir-20b: hif1a was found to be a validated target of mir-20b, mdr1 a validated target of mir-27a and hipk2a gene regulated by mir-181a and mir-27a."
"to confirm the targeting of hif1a, mdr1 and hipk2 by mir-27a, mir-181a and mir-20b, a correlation analysis was carried out."
"a negative correlation was found between each gene hif1a, mdr1 and hipk2 and the correlated mirna."
"the expression of the three mirna target genes hif1a, mdr1 and hipk2 was studied."
"interestingly, an inverse trend of gene expression was highlighted compared to that of mir-27a, mir-181a and mir-20b."
"higher median expression levels of hif1a, mdr1 and hipk2 were found in gastric n3 tumors and in males, while no difference was found in gene expression with respect to tumor size or gc patient age."
"these data established that mir-200b binds the gata-4 3'-utr region, resulting in mrna degradation and translation repression."
mir-199a* is a direct regulator of cox-2 expression in oa chondrocytes.
"these results demonstrated that mir-199a* and mir-101_3 both bindthe seed sequence present in the 3'-utr of human cox-2 mrna, but the inhibitory effect on luciferase activity was more pronounced for mir-199a*."
this suggests an indirect effect of mir-101_3 on the post-transcriptional regulation of cox-2 expression in oa chondrocytes.
these data suggest that il-1-beta-induced activation of p38-mapk negatively regulates the expression of mir-199a* which may be necessary for the unobstructed translation of cox-2 mrna and expression of cox-2 protein in human oa chondrocytes.
"to identify the target gene of the mir-17-5p with ulk1 through the informatics software, we found the binding site as ; dual luciferase data shows that the mir-17-5p can obviously inhibit the luciferase activity of ulk1-3'-utr, but not the luciferase activity of ulk1-3'-utr mutant, ; our data shows that the mir-17-5p can obviously inhibit the expression of ulk1 protein by western-blot ."
"thus, our data demonstrate that mir-31 is capable of directly targeting a sequence within the 3'-utr of gprc5a mrna and that gprc5a is one of the key targets of mir-31 in treg-cell differentiation."
mll and af4 mrnas possess several putative mir-128b binding sites that are responsible for down-regulation by mir-128b.
"to determine whether these sites allow down-regulation by mir-128b, and thus whether mir-128 can down-regulate mll and af4, as well as the chimeric mll-af4 and af4-mll mrnas, the 3'-utr regions containing these mir-128b binding sites were cloned downstream of the reporter renilla luciferase open reading frame."
"in this study, we observed that the expression of mir-125a was inversely correlated with hur expression in several different breast carcinoma cell lines."
increased cytoplasmic localization of hur is a prognostic marker in breast cancer.
real time pcr and gene reporter assays indicated that hur was translationally repressed by mir-125a.
re-establishing mir-125a expression in breast cancer cells decreased hur protein level and inhibited cell growth.
"importantly, the repression of cell proliferation and migration engendered by mir-125a was partly rescued by hur re-expression."
"our results suggest that mir-125a may function as a tumor suppressor for breast cancer, with hur as a direct and functional target."
"we found that apobec3g also blocks dnd1 function to restore mir-372 and mir-206 inhibition through the 3'-utrs of lats2 and cx43, respectively."
"in summary, these experiments lead us to conclude that apobec3g is able to block dnd1 function and restore mirna-mediated translation repression."
"in turn, zeb2 is also a direct target of mir-145."
"taken together, our results demonstrated that zeb2 was a bona fide target of mir-145. in this study, we have found that mir-145 directly targets zeb2 and represses zeb2 expression, and in turn, zeb2 suppresses the expression of mir-145 in pca."
modulation of mir-155 and mir-125b levels following lipopolysaccharide/tnf-alpha stimulation and their possible roles in regulating the response to endotoxin shock.
we find a significant negative regulatory effect on the myo6 3'utr by both mir-143 and mir-145.
mutation of the potential binding sites for mir-143 and mir-145 in the myo6 3'utr resulted in a loss of responsiveness to the corresponding mirna.
our data indicate that mir-143 and mir-145 are involved in the regulation of myo6 expression and possibly in the development of prostate cancer.
myo6 is a direct target of mir-143 and mir-145.
these data show that the myo6 mrna is an independent targetfor both mir-145 and mir-143.
"since the stimulation of rcsa transcription by this small rna does not depend on any sequences from within the rcsa transcript, dsra acts, either directly or indirectly, on rcsa transcription initiation."
"in addition, pten was identified to be directly regulated by mir-1297 through western blot and luciferase reporter assay."
"luciferase reporter assay and western blot were performed to validate the relationship between mir-1297 and pten. in the western blot analysis, the downregulation of mir-1297 could significantly upregulate pten expression compared with the control group ."
"as for the luciferase reporter assay, mir-1297 decreased luciferase activity with pten 3'utr, but had no effect on luciferase reporter with mutated mir-1297 binding elements ."
"levels of lincrna-ufc1 correlated with those of -beta-catenin in hcc tissues. in contrast, there was a negative correlation between levels of microrna 34a and lincrna-ufc1 in hcc tissues; microrna 34a reduced the stability of lincrna-ufc1."
"overexpression of a second srna, glmy, also activates glms expression in an unknown way.the data reveal a regulatory that glmy acts indirectly in a way that depends on glmz."
"when the intracellular glcn-6-p concentration decreases, glmy accumulates and causes in turn accumulation of full-length glmz, which finally activates glms expression. in glmz mutants, glmy has no effect on glms, whereas artificially expressed glmz can activate glms expression also in the absence of glmy."
"impressively, overexpression of mir-296-5p showed the same phenocopy as the effect of plk1 knockdown in nsclc cells, indicating that plk1 was a major target of mir-296-5p."
"furthermore, using western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assay, plk1 protein expression was proved to be regulated by mir-296-5p through binding to the putative binding sites in its 3'-untranslated region ."
the above results suggested that mir-296-5p could directly target 3'-utr of plk1.
these results further proved that plk1 expression could be mediated by mir-296-5p through targeting its mrna 3'-utr.
figure 5. curcuminoids regulate the expression of zbtb10 through a mir-27a-ros-dependent suppression.
"in addition, zbtb10 is a mir-27a mrna target and a member of the pok family of transcriptional repressors ."
"moreover, in cells transfected with pzbtb10-3'utr luciferase construct, treatment with curcuminoids increased luciferase activity directly linked to suppression of mir-27a and decreased interaction with the 3'-utr of zbtb10 ,and transfection with the zbtb10 expression vector, decreased expression of sp1, sp3, sp4, and sp-regulated gene mdr1 ."
the results indicated that the suppression of mir-21 by mir-21 aso significantly increased both the mrna and protein level of lrrfip1 .
"combining targetprediction bioinformatics with expression profiling, we identified lrrfip1, which was remarkably upregulated in mir-21 aso treated cells, as a candidate targetgene of mir-21."
these findings suggested that lrrfip1 was directly regulated by mir-21.
notch 1 and yy1 are confirmed targets of mir-34a .
"exposure of esophageal cells to bile acids activates fxr and increases levels of mirs 221 and 222, reducing levels of p27kip1 and promoting degradation of cdx2 by the proteasome."
"subsequently, mir-125a-5p silenced hdac5 post-transcriptionally in the cells treated with hdaci."
"thus, a regulatory loop may exist in human breast cancer cells involving mir-125a-5p and hdac5 that is controlled by runx3 signaling."
"silencing of mir-125a-5p and runx3 inhibited cancer progression and activated apoptosis, but silencing of hdac5 had a converse effect."
"based on computational analyses revealing 3 mir-16-binding sites in the 3- utr of kcnj2 , we conducted western blot analysis and luciferase reporter gene assays to experimentally clarify whether kcnj2 is in fact a target for mir-16."
transfection of mir-16 into h9c2 rat ventricular cells produced marked downregulation of kir2.1 protein expression compared to sham-treated control cells .
kcnj2 mrna expression was also decreased by mir-16 .
"the regulation of the kcnj2 gene by mir-16 was confirmed by a luciferase assay, which indicated that all 3 binding sites for mir-16 responded to mir-16 expression changes."
"we also found that mir-181a negatively regulated the expression of prkcd, a pro-apoptotic protein kinase, via targeting its 3'-untranslated region , thereby inhibiting irradiation-induced apoptosis and decreasing g2/m block."
these data suggest that xbp1 also is a target of mir-214 in cardiomyocyte.
"the suppression of mir-221 resulted in decreased expression of k-ras, and nf-kappab both at the mrna level and at the protein level ."
"these results suggest that inhibiting the expression of mir-221 in caf-19 cells led to the inhibition of cell migration, invasion, and the expression of its targets k-ras and nf-kappab."
tp53inp1 phosphorylates p53 protein at serine-46.
"this enhances p53 protein stability and its transcriptional activity, leading to transcriptional activation of p53-target genes such as p21 and pig3, cell growth arrest and apoptosis upon dna damage stress."
"deficiency in tp53inp1 expression results in increased tumorigenesis, whereas tp53inp1 expression is repressed during early stages of cancer by factors such as mir-155."
mir-195 can repress the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells via regulating fra-1.
"we found that mir-195 expression was downregulated in two prostate cancer cell lines, ectopic expression of mir-195 significantly suppressed cell migratory and invasive capacities of pc3 and du145 cells through inhibition of fra-1."
these findings indicated that mir-195 could be a potential tumor suppressor by directly binding to fra-1 in prostate cancer.
these findings indicated that mir-195 inhibited fra-1 expression through direct binding of 3'-utr of its transcript.
"moreover, dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that mir-195 could specifically inhibit fra-1 by binding to a critical region located on its 3'-utr."
"it was confirmed flotillin-1 as a direct target of mir-485-5p, and up-regulation of mir-485-5p could decrease expression of flot1 in gastric cancer cells."
"our study suggested that mir-485-5p could be a potential prognostic marker and functions as a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer by post-transcriptionally targeting flot1. in a conclusion, our study found that mir-485-5p was identified a tumor suppressor mirna in gastric cancer cells and can negatively regulate flot1 expression in vitro and in vivo."
lats2 is direct target gene of rno-mir-31.
the online software targetscan predicts that lats2 has a mir-31 binding site in its 3'-utr.
the results demonstrated that lats2 is indeed a target gene protein of rno-mir-31 in vivo.
"to explore whether mir-21 can serve as a therapeutic target for glioblastoma, we downregulated mir-21 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide and found that apoptosis was induced and cell-cycle progression was inhibited in vitro in u251 and ln229 gbm cells; xenograft tumors from antisense-treated u251 cells were suppressed in vivo."
"targetscan 6.2 21 and pictar 22 were used to select the target of mir-18a, and interferon regulatory factor 2 , which was found to be related with cell proliferation by go analysis, was predicted as a potential target."
"mir-18a suppressed the luciferase activity of the wt irf2 3'utr , without effect on mut irf2 3'utr in 293 t cells."
these results indicated that mir-18a suppressed irf2 expression post-transcriptionally.
"e confirmation of predicted mir-10a gene target by luciferase reporter assay: arnt, gtfh1, id4, klf4, mapre1, nr4a3, rb1cc1 and tfap2c were confirmed to be mir-10a repressible by this assay."
"reporter assay confirmed arnt, gtfh1, id4, klf4, mapre1, nr4a3, rb1cc1 and tfap2c to be mir-10a repressible genes, with further evidence of targeting specificity provided by site directed mutagenesis of the mir-10a binding site ."
"mir-221 binds the targetsite in the 3 '-utr of the cdkn1c/p57 mrna to inhibit cdkn1c/p57 expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing to promote crc occurrence and progress, therefore serving as a potential therapeutic targetfor the prevention and treatment of crc. to investigate the regulatory effect of mir-221 on cdkn1c/p57 protein expression in crc, we examined cdkn1c/p57 mrna expression in 34 crc samples by semi-quantitative rt-pcr."
"luciferase report assay further confirmed that tgf-alpha 3'-utr is a direct target of mir-205. in this study, we provide an important insight in support of mir-205 functioning as a tumor suppressor in os via targeting tgf-alpha."
"moreover, mir-205-transfected cells showed a dramatic decrease in cell invasion and migration, accompanied with suppressed expression of tgf-alpha, which contains a putative binding site of mir-205 in its 3'-utr confirmed by luciferase assays; and qrt-pcr and western blot results confirmed that in os cells transfection with mir-205, the expression of tgf-alpha mrna and protein were both suppressed."
our data also verified that bcl-2 is the target of mir-125b.
"more importantly, we proved that mir-125b increased the chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cell lines to cisplatin by targeting bcl-2."
"additionally, we demonstrated that bcl-2 is a downstream target of mir-125b and negatively regulated by mir-125b binding to its 3 ' untranslated region ."
these results suggest that mir-125b directly targets bcl-2 by binding its seed region to their 3 ' -utr in os cells.
"taken together, these results showed clearly that oxr1 is a downstream target of mir-200b."
these results confirmed hsf2 as a direct target of mir-18 and identified the site of interaction in the 3'utr of hsf2 mrna.
"interestingly, the mrna levels of hsf2 also decreased in relation to the transfected amount of mir-18 , suggesting that mir-18 is able to operate through destabilizing hsf2 mrna."
we therefore conclude that endogenous mir-18 is able to regulate the expression of hsf2.
"this pattern of expression, exhibiting an inverse correlation between mir-18 and hsf2 , strongly suggests that mir-18 targets hsf2 in spermatogenesis."
these results clearly demonstrate that mir-18 downregulates hsf2 in spermatogenesis.
"next we used luciferase reporter assays based on luciferase constructs harboring wt or mutated mir-200c mres sequences in the 3- utr to confirm that all four genes were direct targets of mir-200c, but not of mir-141 ."
"mir-200 targets dnajc3, which encodes an established and crucial chaperone in beta cells, and lower dnajc3 levels may partially explain the higher atf3 mrna levels detected upon mir-200 overexpression."
we show that mir-200 negatively regulates a conserved anti-apoptotic and stress-resistance network that includes the essential beta cell chaperone dnajc3 and the caspase inhibitor xiap.
in silico database and genome-wide gene expression analyses revealed that itga3 and itgb1 were direct targets of mir-223 regulation.
these data suggested that mir-223 bound directly to specific sites in the 3'-utrs of itga3 and itgb1 mrna.
these data suggested that the role of itga3 or itgb1 protein was modulated by mir-223 and the effects of migration and invasion in pca cells.
"b-cell translocationgene 1 was identified as a new target of mir-22, which could reverse theinhibition of autophagy induced by mir-22."
"thus, p21 is a key targetfor the cell cycle function of the mir-106b family."
we show that p21 is a direct target of mir-106b and that its silencing plays a key role in mir-106b-induced cell cycle phenotypes.
the p21 mrna 3'-utr contains two hexamers complementary to the mir-106b family seed region.
"to test for direct effects on the p21 transcript by mir-106b micrornas, we used a luciferase reporter carrying the complete p21 mrna 3'-utr."
"here, we investigate the expression of mir-203 and two of its targets, p63 and suppressor of cytokine signalling-3, during human skin morphogenesis."
"as one may expect it with mirna:target pairs, p63 and socs-3 as its targets were preferentially expressed in the basal epidermal layer where mir-203 was absent ."
"to demonstrate the specificity of interaction between mir-203 and the mirna recognition motif within socs-3 3'-utr, we generated a site-specific mutation in the mir-203 binding site."
"when the predicted mir-203 binding site in the 3'-utr of socs-3 mrna was mutated, luciferase activity was restored ."
"p63 has been shown to be directly targeted by mir-203 . in concordance, we found that p63 and mir-203 showed mutually exclusive expression pattern within the epidermis during human skin development, further supporting a role for mir-203 as a switch between proliferating basal cells and differentiating suprabasal cells."
the results indicated that mir-493 obviously reduced the expression of mrna and protein of rhoc but not fzd4 and igf1r.
mir-493 inhibited the capability of invasion of gastric cancer in vitro by targeting rhoc.
these results suggested that rab27b is the target of mir-193a-3p and that srr is the target of mir-193a-5p.
"thus, mir-193a-3p and mir-193a-5p decrease the expression of rab27b and srr, respectively, by directly targeting their 3'utrs."
"overexpression of mir-335 resulted in an upregulation of brca1 mrna expression, suggesting a functional dominance of id4 signaling."
"in summary, our data indicate that mir-335 affects different targets in the upstream brca1-regulatory cascade with impact on key cellular functions such as proliferation and apoptosis."
overexpression of let-7a can inhibit the growth of lung cancer transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice by suppression of k-ras and c-myc.
these data provided a strong indication that let-7a significantly inhibited the expression of k-ras and c-myc in vivo.
"our data as well as other previous studies indicated that overexpression of let-7a could suppress the expression of k-ras and c-myc, thus leading to the growth inhibition of lung cancer in vivo. in summary, our study showed that let-7a prevented the tumor growth of human lung cancer transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice by suppression of k-ras and c-myc expression."
"furthermore, mir-181b contributed to proliferation of aml cells by targeting mlk2."
the results indicated that suppression of mir-181b significantly increased both the level of mlk2 mrna and protein .
"knockdown of mir-21 resulted in significant upregulation of programmed cell death protein 4, a proapoptotic target gene of mir-21, and substantially increased tubular cell apoptosis."
"furthermore, mir-490-3p bound directly to hmga2 mrna 3 ' utr and mediated a decrease in hmga2 mrna and protein expression."
these results demonstrate that hmga2 is a functional target of mir-490-3p in osteosarcoma cells.
"taken together, our findings suggest that mir-1915 could play a role in the development of mdr in colorectal carcinoma cells at least in part by modulation of apoptosis via targeting bcl-2."
"these data demonstrate the hwnk4 3'-utr plays an enhancer role by crosstalking with the promoter, and mir-296 suppresses hwnk4 expression through targeting on its 3'-utr in a cell-specific fashion."
these results verified that mir-296 regulated gene expression through binding to the specific sequence of the hwnk4 3'-utr.
"the data suggested that the function of mir-296 was indeed characterized as cell-specific, and mir-296 could downregulate gene expression in certain cell lines."
that demonstrated mir-296 downregulated hwnk4 expression mainly at the translational level.
these finding showed that mir-340 may directly target the 3'utr of mdm2 and have an effect on the regulation of its expression.
"we then carried out a dual-luciferase reporter assay and confirmed that in huh7 and mhcc97l cells, cdc42 was the downstream target of mir-137 ."
"moreover, we identified cdc42 as another downstream target gene of mir-137 in hcc."
dual-luciferase reporter and western blot assays showed that cdc42 was directly regulated by mir-137 in hcc cells.
"further investigations demonstrate that mir-328 acts directly on the 3'utr of ptprj, resulting in reduced mrna levels."
"in this study, we show that overexpression of microrna-328 decreases ptprj expression in hela and skbr3 cells."
"further investigations demonstrate that mir-328 acts directly on the 3'utr of ptprj. in this study, we report that microrna-328 target the 3'utr of ptprj resulting in its decreased expression."
figure 3. mir-328 increases proliferation in hela cells by repressing ptprj.
"taken together, these data indicate that mir-328 directly regulates ptprj expression mainly through interaction with the predicted mre_4 in the 3'-utr of ptprj."
targeting and regulation of creb1 by mir-200b.
all of these data suggest that mir-200b directly target creb1 expression in glioma cells.
"taken together, the results in this work demonstrated that the transcription factor creb1 is regulated by mir-200b in glioma, thereby indirectly regulating its targetgenes."
"in this way, we identified a novel regulatory mechanism of creb1 using mir-200b."
the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that mir-200b could bindto the 3'utr of creb1 mrna .
the finding that mir-302b and mir-372 inhibited tgfbr2 and rhoc expression.
"follow-up experiments confirmed that the escc mirnas function in part through met by targeting at least tgfbr2 and rhoc, but also likely smad2, zeb1 and fn1 to enhance reprogramming."
"furthermore, two binding sites for mir-125b are identified in the 3'utr of e2f2 and overexpression of mir-125b in cd133 positive gscs represses the endogenous level of e2f2 protein."
e2f2 is directly regulated by mir-125b.
mir-125b inhibits the proliferation of cd133 positive gscs mediated by direct downregulation of e2f2.
these results indicate that mir-125b is a regulator of e2f2 in cd133 positive gscs by binding to the two sites in the e2f2 3'-utr.
the results indicate that downregulation of e2f2 is closely related to the effect of mir125b on anti-proliferation.
"ttp promotes an increase in expression of mature let-7, which leads to the inhibition of let-7 targetgene cdc34 expression and suppresses cell growth."
"collectively, these results indicate that ttp inhibits cdc34 expression and let-7b mediates the effect."
figure 2. ttp negatively regulates the expression of the let-7b targetgene cdc34.
these results indicate that ttp affects the expression level of let-7b and cdc34 and the cell growth through down-regulation of lin28a in pa1 cells.
"bcl2, an antiapoptotic molecule, was identified to be a direct target of mir-449a, and the proapoptotic function of mir-449a was mainly through targeting bcl2 expression."
"however, mir-124 cannot decrease the mrna level of nfib , which suggests that the inhibition of nfib expression by mir-124 is at the post-transcriptional level."
"taken together, mir-124 directly targets nfib and thus inhibits mapk/erk signaling."
"in addition, we identified nfib as a direct target of mir-124 and that the activation of wnt/-beta-catenin signaling induced mir-124 expression."
"our observations imply that the loss of mir-26a may result in gained expression of mtdh and ezh2, which endows tumor cells with the ability to develop chemoresistance and in turn favors tumor progression."
these results indicate that the effect of mir-26a is due to specific and direct interaction with the putative binding sites in the 3'-utrs of mtdh and ezh2.
"together, the above results demonstrate that mir-26a suppresses the expression of both mtdh and ezh2 by directly targeting their 3'-utr."
"therefore, mtdh is a functional target of mir-26a for its antitumorigenic role in mcf7 cells."
it was found the downregulated mir-195 and upregulated hif-1alpha were present in hypoxic atdc 5 cells.
mir-195 negatively regulated hif-1alpha by targeting its 3'-untranslated region.
"moreover, the founding indicated mir-195 greatly increased apoptosis and downregulated hif-1alpha mrna occurred simultaneously in hypoxic chondrocytes."
all this data identified the hif-1alpha might be a direct target of mir-195.
all these founding illustrated overexpression of mir-195 increased the apoptosis of atdc 5 cells depending on hif-1alpha on hypoxia.
"hence, our results indicate that sfrp4, gsk3-beta, and tle1 are the bona fide targets of mir-942."
"these results demonstated that sfrp4, gsk3-beta, and tle1 are important for mir-942-induced stem cell-like traits and indicated that wnt/-beta-catenin signalling is a functional mediator for mir-942-搃nduced function in escc cell lines."
ectopic expression of mir-125b by transfection of mir-125b duplex into hek-293t cells suppresses by ;60% the activity of a renilla luciferaseconstruct containing the mir-125b mres of human or zebrafishp53 at its 3' end.
these data indicate that the predicted mres are critical for the direct and specific binding of mir-125b to the p53 mrna.
the inverse correlation between mir-125b and p53 expression/activity supports our hypothesis that p53 is down-regulated by mir-125b during zebrafishembryogenesis.
"taken together, our results suggest that mir-203, -205, - 30c2 targets runx2 and that mir-320 targets -beta- catenin at mrna and protein level."
"hobs responded to intermittent pth stimulation by repression of hsa-mir-30c, hsa-mir-203, hsa-mir-205, and hsa-mir-320, with a concomitant increase in a target gene for these mirnas; runx2."
"mir-30c2, mir-203 and mir-205 targeting runx2, and mir-320 targeting -beta-catenin mrna expression."
exosome-derived microrna-29c induces apoptosis of biu-87 cells by down regulating bcl-2 and mcl-1.
"collectively, these data indicate that mir-497 expression is decreased and igf-1r expression is increased in hcc tissues."
mirna-497 overexpression may suppress cellular growth by targeting igf-1r and inhibiting activation of the pi3k/akt pathway in hcc-derived cell lines.
"mutations in the predicted seed sequence allowed us to validate mir-142-3p interaction with the two genes showing the strongest impairment of luciferase activity, i.e., il6st and egr2."
"among those 13 mirnas that were differentially expressed in the hbss or rapamycin-treated cells, we found in the 3'-utr of beclin 1 the consensus sequences for mir-30a, implying thatbeclin 1 is a potential target for mir-30a."
"to verify the change of mir-30a expression following hbss or rapamycin treatment, we performed qrt-pcr analysis of the endogenous mir-30a expression."
"using the mimic and antagomir of mir-30a, these experiments demonstrated a suppressive role for this mirna in beclin 1 expression."
these results indicated that mir-9-3p regulated taz expression by directly targeting its 3'utr.
there was an inverse correlation between mir-9-3p and taz mrna expression in hcc cell lines
endogenous mir-101 regulates expression of app in human cells via a specific site located within its 3'utr.
"mir-101 significantly reduced reporter expression by greater than 40% compared to cells co-transfected with negative control mimic or app 3'-utr reporter alone, confirming that mir-101 can downregulate gene expression via elements in the app 3'-utr ."
"therefore, mir-101 regulates reporter expression specifically via site 1 in app 3'-utr."
"thus, endogenous mir-101 in human hela cells regulates app expression specifically via site 1 in 3'-utr."
the fact that mir-124a was predicted to be only partially complementary to the c/ebpalpha 3- utr bindsg site strengthened our hypothesis that mir-124a might block translation of c/ebpalpha mrna rather than degrading it.
"to validate the predicted interaction between mir-124a and c/ebpalpha, we prepared a luciferase construct by inserting the c/ebpalpha 3- utr downstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pgl3 promoter vector."
"relative luciferase activity was significantly decreased 24 hours after mir-124a transfection compared with transfection with the control mirna, indicating that mir-124a interferes with c/ebpalpha mrna via a direct interaction with the 3- utr ."
"after 48 h, c/ebpalpha protein decreased substantially, supporting our hypothesis that mir-124a negatively regulates c/ebpalpha"
"western blotting analysis was performed, which indicated that mir-7 directly inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor and further antagonized the downstream protein kinases including erk, akt and stat3."
"mir-7 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of akt, erk and stat3, as well as mmp-2, mmp-9, survivin and pcna , which suggested that mir-7 exerted its antitumor function by direct targeting egfr on the surface of glioma cells and further antagonizing egfr-mediated downstream signaling cascade ."
further experiments of dual luciferase assays verified microrna-16 directly targeting bmi-1.
"collectively, these findings indicate that loss of microrna-16 may favor glioma angiogenesis, on the contrary overexpression of microrna-16 in gbm cells plays a critical role in repressing endothelial function and angiogenesis by targeting bmi-1."
"dual luciferase assays in a172 and u87 cells confirmed that mir-16 targets the bmi-1 3'-utr . in our study, we showed that mir-16 inhibited endothelial function and glioma angiogenesis through down-regulating bmi-1in glioma cells."
"perfect matches exist between the seed regions of mir-365 and the 3'-utr of nfib, suggesting that mir-365 can directly repress nfib expression which were verified by cloning the fragments of the nfib 3'-utr regions encompassing the target sites to the downstream of the firefly luciferase gene."
such targeting effects were specific to mir-365 binding because the reporter activity was less affected when transfections were repeated with mutant mir-365 binding sites in the nfib 3'-utr.
the above results indicated that nfib is definitely one of the targets of mir-365 in both normal and cscc cells and knockdown of mir-365 could alleviate the repression and upregulate the expression of nfib.
"mir-146a and mir-146b inhibited irak1 and traf6 expression by binding to the 3'-utr of irak1 or traf6, respectively, in the rat macrophage cell line nr8383."

"consistent with this, an increase in gata5 transcript levels was observed in mir-92 morphants as compared with nics ."
"these results show that the increase or reduction of endodermal cell numbers caused by raising or lowering gata5 levels, together with the finding that increased and decreased levels of mir-92 have converse effects that can be offset by altered gata5 expression, support the idea that the mir-92-gata5 regulatory interaction is involved in allocating correct endodermal cell numbers and maintaining proper left-right patterning."

"such significant decrease in reporter activity was not seen when the reporter was in the vector containing the mutant igf-1r 3 ' -utr , in spite of the presence of mi-r99b, indicating that sequences in the 5602- 5607 bp region of the igf-1r 3 ' -utr indeed interact with mir-99b, inhibiting expression of igf-1r."
"egfr was selected from several putative mir-133a target genes, since igf-1r has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis ."

"similarly, transfection of mir-125b inhibitor into hbecs increased 4e-bp1 protein expression ."
"however, no significant change of 4e-bp1 mrna level was found after transfection of mir-125b mimic or inhibitor , suggesting that mir-125b can interfere with 4e-bp1 mrna translation but not degradation."
"taken together, these results verified that 4e-bp1 mrna is a direct target of mir-125b."
"however, knockdown of 4e-bp1 gene with sirna could abolish the effect of mir-125b on the further induction of ifn-alpha/-beta in beas-2b cells, which indicates that the effect of mir-125b was specifically caused by targeting of 4e-bp1 mrna."

"the expression levels of ezh2 and cfos, other targets of mir-101a , were not significantly altered at the mrna level but substantially increased at the protein level ."
the increase in the protein amount without a significant change in the rna amount indicated that ezh2 and cfos were regulated post-transcriptionally in the liver of the mice.
"to furthermore determine whether extracellular timp-1 is sufficient to induce mir-210 upregulation, we incubated a549l with recombinant timp-1 in a concentration similar to timp-1 levels in lung cancer patients 13 or with medium conditioned by timp-1 overexpressing cells."
we found significant upregulation of mature mir-210 as well as pri-mir-210 upon extracellular timp-1 stimulation which suggests a paracrine mode-of-action by which timp-1 can induce mir-210 in a549l adenocarcinoma cells.
we could also verify the underlying concept as a knockdown of timp-1 led to a reduction of pri-mir-210 and mir-210 in a human ovarian carcinoma cell line as well as a decrease of primir-210 in a549l lung adenocarcinoma cells.
we could show that timp-1-induced increase of mir-210 levels were sufficient to trigger its regulative role and to decrease mir-210 targets.

"rip assay showed that lnc-hc-nucleoprotein complex could bind to the cyp7a1 and abca1 mrnas, whereas lnc-hc did not bind to target mrnas in the absence of nucleoproteins ."
"lnc-hc increased the expression of hnrnpa2b1 in nucleus and they formed an rna-protein complex, which further bound to the target mrnas, cyp7a1 and abca1."
"it is noteworthy that dnmt3a/3b expression levels exhibited an inverse correlation with mir29b, which suggested that these molecules are targets of mir29b and are negatively regulated by mir29b in mouse early embryos."

"taken together, these data suggest that mir-130/301 expression are dramatically enhanced after t-cell activation and down-regulate cd69 expression in cd8+ t cells."
"we demonstrate that mir-30b/c and mir-21 target respectively the 3' untranslated region of caspase-3 and tap63 mrnas, and that those proteins mediate some of the effects of mir-30 and -21 on trail resistance, even in human glioblastoma primary cells and in lung cancer cells."
programmed cell death 10 is the direct target of mir-425-5p which is required for the regulatory role of mir-425-5p in chemoresistance.
we provided evidence that mir-425-5p can directly modulate chemoresistance in these cells by regulating the expression level of its downstream target pdcd10 both in vitro and in vivo.
"as shown in figure 4e, cotransfection of mir-425-5p precursor with wild-type pdcd103 0 -utr reporter construct significantly repressed relative luciferase activity, whereas mutation of the mir-425-5p-binding site eliminated this effect, supporting that pdcd10 is a direct target of mir-425-5p in crc cells."

"looking for the effectors of these antineoplastic functions, we identified adam9 and mmp7, two metalloproteases playing a pivotal role in melanoma progression, as direct targets of mir-126&126*."
"mir-126&126* play their tumor suppression function through the direct inhibition of adam9 and mmp7, in turn impairing the activation of their common target heparin-binding egf-like growth factor . as shown , co-transfection experiments with the wildtype 39utr regions of adam9 and mmp7 showed a significant inhibition of the luciferase activity, thus confirming the direct targeting of mir-126&126*."
"in this report, we demonstrated that adam9 and mmp7 were direct targets of mir-126&mir-126*, whereas they only indirectly regulated opn , possibly through an auto-sustaining loop linking opn and mmp7 ."
"mcas could base-pair with the flhd 5'-utr in two regions, relieving the secondary structure around the ribosome binding site, resulting in increased translation of the flhd and flhc proteins."

"mir-22 exhibited excellent anti-lung cancer activity in vitro and in vivo, and post-transcriptional regulation of erbb3 might be a potential mechanism."
all these results indicated that mir-22 exert inhibitory effects on erbb3 expression via interaction with the 3'-utr of erbb3.
"additionally, over-expression of erbb3 in a549 and h1299 cells significantly prevents the inhibitory effects of mir-22 on proliferation and invasion."
"the cell cycle regulator ccnd1, and ras-mapk pathway components grb2, erk2 and rsk2 were directly repressed by mir-634 overexpression."
"we show that mir-634 regulates cyclin d1 and several ras-mapk pathway components , which may contribute to the effects of mir-634 on ovarian cancer cell survival and chemotherapy response."
"as expected, mir-634 could inhibit the 3'-utr of ccnd1 and grb2, the erk2 3'-utr and the rsk2 3'-utr . in addition, we observed that mir-634 overexpression in ovarian cancer cell lines and patient samples negatively regulates important cell-cycle genes and ras-mapk pathway components ."
our previous study has identified jak2 as a downstream target of mir-375 .
mir-375 may inhibit the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells partially by targeting jak2.

"thus, our results indicate that mir-124 regulates the expression of hes-1 at the post-transcriptional level and is involved in the retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of p19 cells."
"these results suggest that the expression of mir-124 might be associated with the differentiation of p19 cells. in addition, it is possible that a relationship exists between mir-124 and hes-1. in contrast, the level of hes-1 protein increased in the presence of lna-mir-124 ; however, the level of hes-1 mrna was unchanged ."
these results strengthen our hypothesis that mir-124 regulates the expression of hes-1.
lsy-6 exerts its effects on asel through repression of cog-1.
here we show that hmga2 promotes lung cancer progression in mouse and human cells by operating as a competing endogenous rna for the let-7 microrna family.
"hmga2 can promote the transformation of lung cancer cells independent of protein-coding function but dependent upon the presence of let-7 sites; this occurs without changes in the levels of let-7 isoforms, suggesting that hmga2 affects let-7 activity by altering mirna targeting."
"taken together, these results suggest that the hmga2 transcript functions in a largely protein coding-independent but let-7 site-dependent manner to promote lung cancer cell transformation in vitro."
"thus, these results demonstrate hmga2, via its let-7 binding sites, displaces tgfbr3 from mirna-mediated repression by risc. in total, these results suggest the hmga2 cerna directly functions by blocking recruitment of tgfbr3 to the ago2-based mirna repression complex."

"these results demonstrated mir-206 inhibited c-met and bcl2 expression in a549 cells, and loss of mir-206 would be attributed to the over-expression of c-met and bcl2 in lung cancer cells, which were the risks of nscls."
"second, mir-206 can directly regulate mrna expression by targeting the 3'-utr of met and bcl2, and inhibit protein expression of cyclin d1 and gene expression of cyclin d1, cyclin d2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 , while increased p57 gene expression in lung cancer cell ."

"we confirmed that mir-196a specifically targets krt5, sprr2c, and s100a9 3' utrs using mir-196a-mimic and luciferase reporter-based assays. in conclusion, this study identified mir-196a as a potential marker of progression of be and krt5, sprr2c, and s100a9 as its targets."
"klhl12, rock2, tal1, cmpk1, snai2, and snai1 are regulated by ncrna-a2 through ncrna-a7, respectively."
knockdown of ncrna-a7 in a549 cells represses the expression of snai1 specifically and diminishes cell migration to levels similar to that seen when knocking down snai1.
ncrna-a7 serves as a transcriptional enhancer of snai1.

we identified sp1 protein as a target of mir-711 using luciferase assay and western blot analysis .
"sp1 protein is negatively regulated by mir-711 in cardiac fibroblasts, and its mrna expression is not altered by mir-711 ."
the findings in this study show that cyar transcription is dependent on the camp-crp complex and that cyar rna plays a major role in carbon catabolite regulation of ompx expression.the
conservation of cyar and the ompx shine dalgarno region suggests that cyar rna acts as a posttranslation regulator of ompx expression by an antisense mechanism in many enterobacteriaceae.
"moreover, partial mutation of the perfectly complementary sites in the 3'-utr of smad4 abolished the suppressive effect due to the disruption of the interaction between mir-34a and smad4 ."

"fih1 therefore may represent a very attractive common target for mir-31 and -148a implicated in gmb. the mir-148a-mediated modulation was abolished by a mutation within the binding site 1, indicating that mir-148a directly binds and represses fih1 expression ."
"altogether, these data indicate that high levels of mir-31 or mir-148a promote glioma growth by down-regulation of fih1 and thereby enhancing hif1alpha and notch pathway activity, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor progenitor expansion even in the normoxic conditions ."
"in mice, knockdown of mir-192 led to up-regulation of atp1b1 protein."
"interestingly, mir-192 appeared to target atp1b1 through the 5'-, rather than 3'-untranslated region."
mir-192 regulates atp1b1 expression and na + /k + - atpase activity in human kidney cells.
"overall, these results suggested mir-192 interaction with atp1b1 5'-utr as the possible mechanism by which mir-192 reduces atp1b1 abundance."
we also showed that mir-192 interacted with atp1b1 in an unconventional manner involving the 5'-utr.

"the expression levels of mir-137 and lsd1 mrna were determined in six crc cell lines by taqman rt-pcr and rt-pcr, respectively . in crc cell lines with lower endogenous mir-137 expression , a higher lsd1 expression level was observed, whereas in the ht29 cell line, which has higher expression levels of mir-137, the amount of lsd1 was much lower."
"to determine if the 3'-utr region of lsd1 was indeed a functional targetsite of mir-137, a luciferase reporter plasmid harboring either wild-type or mutated predicted region of interaction at the lsd1 3'-utr region was constructed."
the dual luciferase activity assay revealed that mirna-181b downregulated bcl-2 expression.
the results from western blot analysis showed a reduced bcl-2 expression following mir-181b transfection but an enhanced caspase-3 activity in mirna-181b mimic-transfected pdac cells.
"we also performed elisa to detect caspase-3 activity and found that caspase-3 activity increased with mirna-181b overexpression, but was reduced following treatment with a mirna-181b inhibitor."

bioinformatics analysis has indicated that gpc3 is a putative target of mir-219-5p.
"dual-luciferase assay, qrt-pcr and western blot analysis identified gpc3 as one of the genes directly targeted by mir-219-5p."
a decrease in mir-219-5p expression was shown to be inversely correlated with gpc3 protein expression levels in 45 pairs of hcc tissue samples.
these results suggest that mir-219-5p interacts with gpc3 and negatively regulates its expression.
cse1l is the targetgene of mir-137.
these results suggested a direct interaction between mir-137 and putative binding site on cse1l.
"sequence analysis indicated that mir-137 formed complementary base pairing at nucleotides 482- 488 of cse1l 3'-utr, and mir-137 binding site on 3'-utr of cse1l was conserved across eight species ."
the results suggested that mir-137 targeted cse1l and regulated its expression at translation level.

"we propose that cocaine would downregulate zfmor, zfdor1 and zfdor2 via dre-let-7d, since overexpression and knockdowns of opioid receptors altered the expression of dre-let-7d and its precursors at 48 hpf of zebrafish development."
"finally, we showed that mir-34a's underlying mechanism during cardiac fibrosis occurs through the targeting of smad4 expression."
"our findings provide evidence that mir-34a plays a critical role in the progression of cardiac tissue fibrosis by directly targeting smad4, which suggests that mir-34a may be new marker for cardiac fibrosis progression and that inhibition of mir-34a may be a promising strategy in the treatment of cardiac fibrosis."
"as shown in figure 5b and c , transfection of mir-34a precursors clearly reduced luciferase activity for the wild-type reporter but did not for the mutant type smad4 3垄utr, which confirmed that smad4 is directly modulated by mir-34a."
cdk6 had already been implicated as a mirna-107 target .
"expression of the kinase was assessed only after overexpressing mirna-107, and it was left open whether cdk6 is regulated solely at the protein level or if cdk6 mrna degradation is induced by mirna-107."
overexpression of mirna-107 led to a decrease of cdk6 reporter activity .
this supports the notion that cdk6 is directly controlled by mirna-107.
"in summary, the results indicate that cdk6 and p130 protein levels are under control of mirna-107 but p130 may not be a direct target of this mirna."
"furthermore, we demonstrate mir-29 inhibition of cdk6 protein and mrna levels by direct binding to 3'-untranslated region."
"ectopic expression of mir-29a, mir-29b, or mir-29c significantly reduced cdk6 expression in mino and hek293t cells."

"mature mir-146a could bind to two highly complementary target sequences located in nucleotides 678- 699 and 1504- 1525 of the rock1 gene transcript, indicating that rock1 mrna was a strong target for mir-146a."

c-myc as a direct mir-135a targetin rcc cell lines.
"to determine whether the 3'-utr of c-myc contained an actual targetsite for mir-135a, we carried out a luciferase reporter assay using a vector encoding the full-length 3'-utr of the c-myc gene."
"our data showed that luminescence intensity was significantly reduced in mir-135a transfectants compared to mir-control transfectants . in conclusion, mir-135a was significantly downregulated in rcc clinical specimens and appeared to function as a tumor suppressor in rcc through regulation of c-myc expression and cell cycle progression."

"first, we verified that map3k8 is a targetfor mir-370 using luciferase reporter constructs containing the mir-370 recognition sequence from the 3'-utr of map3k8 inserted downstream of the luciferase gene."
"taken together, these data indicate that map3k8 is a biologically relevant target of mir-370 and that upregulation of map3k8 is not a general result of promotion of cell proliferation."
"a target prediction program, targetscan,showed that mucin 1 may be a potential target of mir-145."
the 3'-utr of the mucin 1 mrna contains a conserved binding site for the seed region of mir-145.
"conversely, in luciferase assays using a plasmid harboring a mutant version of the mucin 1 mrna 3 '-utr ,the luciferase activity of the mutant reporter was unaffected by transfection of mir-145 into a549 and nci-h520 cells ."
these data suggest that mir-145 may suppress mucin1 gene expression through the mir-145 binding sequence in its 3 '-utr.
"fbxo11 was indicated to be a potential target gene of mir-621, which was also found as a downregulated deg in pcr patients in the training set ."

"we found that overexpression of mir-621 could significantly decrease the expression of fbxo11 in hct116 wt cells, but not in hct116 dicer-/- cells , suggesting that the repression of fbxo11 by mir-621 is dicer-dependent."
"in accordance, mir-621 overexpression significantly repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter fused to fbxo11 3'-utr, but not the one fused to fbxo11 3'-utr mutant in which mir-621-recognition site was deleted ."
all these data strongly support that mir-621 may repress fbxo11 expression through recognition of its binding site within fbxo11 3'-utr in human cancer cells.
from this screen we identified and characterized mir-148a as a negative regulator of ldlr expression and activity and defined a sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 -mediated pathway through which mir-148a regulates ldl-c uptake.
here we show that mir-148a directly controls ldlr activity and is transcriptionally activated by srebp1c in vitro and in vivo.
"using computational prediction, we found that the 3'utr of carma1 mrna contains one mir-539 binding site."
"the luciferase activity assays indicated that mir-539 mimics significantly inhibited and anti-mir-539 significantly increased the reporter activity of the wild-type but not that of the mutant carma1 3'-utr, suggesting that mir-539 directly binds to this site ."
"overexpression of mir-539 dramatically decreased carma1 at the mrna and protein level, whereas anti-mir-539 increased carma1 levels in k1 cells."
"mmp-2 and mmp-9 were identified as potential target for mir-29a and mir-133a, respectively, and mmp-2 was subsequently verified as a mir-29a targetin vitro."
"lastly, to examine the relationship between total mmp-2 protein abundance and mir-29a expression in the aortic specimens, linear least-squares regression modeling was again performed, and a significant inverse relationship between mir-29a expression and total mmp-2 abundance was identified ; indicating that as mir-29a decreased, the relative abundance of mmp-2 increased ."
"the results demonstrated that overexpression of mir-29a attenuated total mmp-2 protein abundance, while overexpression of anti-mir-29a enhanced total mmp-2 protein abundance."
"mir-27a*, mir-378, and mir-30e directly target perforin and/or grzb, which are significantly down-regulated in denv patients."
dkk-1 and dact3 are direct targetcandidates of mir-31.
"collectively, these experiments strongly suggested that mir-31 modulates dkk-1 and dact3 via post-transcriptional and translational-inhibitory mechanisms in cultured normal respiratory epithelia and lung cancer cells."
"collectively, these experiments strongly suggest that mir-31 directly interacts with 3'-utrs of dkk-1 and dact3."
"among these p53/mir-34 associated processes, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are known as essential for p53/mir-34-mediated tumor suppression."
"a negative correlation between mir-27a and bak was also observed in normal breast epithelial cell line mcf-10a and bc cell lines, suggesting that the bak is the potential target of mir-27a."
"these results suggest that the gene of bak is a functional target of mir-27a, which may play an essential role for the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents."
"in this study, we show that microrna-196 inhibits hoxb8 expression in myeloid differentiation of hl 60 cells."
mir-196 has perfect complementarity with targetsequence of 3'-utr in hoxb8 mrna.

these results suggest that mir-196 participates in myeloid differentiation of hl60 cells via regulation of hoxb8 expression.
mir-29 mirnas targetp85alpha and cdc42.
"another potential target of mir-29 mirnas was the cdc42 mrna, which contains two targetsites for mir-29 ."
"the cdc42 protein level fell in hela cells that were transfected with mir-29 mirnas, as determined by western blotting ."
these results indicate that mir-150 preferentially targets c-myb translation.
"interestingly, erk5 is the most widely reported direct target of mir-143, which is downregulated by mir-143 overexpression , ."
"importantly, transient overexpression of mir-143 mimetics in hct116 , sw480 and dld-1 colon cancer cell lines has been shown to down-regulate erk5 steady-state levels."
"overexpression of mir-451 down-regulated lu-ciferase activity with the target sequences of cpne3 and rab5a downstream of the firefly luciferase gene, whilesuppression of mir-451 up-regulated luciferase activity ."
"the expression of rab5a was negatively correlated with the expression of mir-451 inra patients ,indicating that rab5a is regulated by mir-451 in raneutrophils."
"further, oncogene ccnd1 was revealed to be a putative target of mir-326, which was inversely correlated with mir-326 expression in nsclc."
"here, we reported that mir-326 is indeed suppressed in primary lung cancers compared with the matching adjacent normal tissues, and found 3'-utr of the human ccnd1 mrna is really a target of mir-326."
these results suggest that mir-326 binds directly to the predicted binding site in the ccnd1 3?utr.
mir-326 targets ccnd1 in lung cancer cells and negatively expressed with ccnd1.
"here, we validated tnf-alpha as the target of mir-181a by a dual luciferase assay."
"our study provides the first evidence of the role of mir-181a in adipocyte differentiation by regulation of tnf-alpha, which may became a new therapeutic target for anti-obesity drugs. in this study, we demonstrated the ability mir-181a to inhibit tnf-alpha expression by targeting the 3'-utr of its mrna, thus affecting adipogenesis."
"thus, tnf-alpha was initially confirmed as the target of mir-181a."
this study demonstrates that mir-181a is a novel regulator of tnf-alpha in porcine adipocytes.
"nevertheless, the ppar-alpha protein level decreased and increased significantly after the overexpression and knockdown of mirna-10b, respectively ."
"thus, these results demonstrated that mirna-10b directly recognized the 3'-utr of the ppar-alpha transcript and mediated its expression post-transcriptionally."
hmga1 can be regulated negatively by mir-26a at both transcriptional level and protein level in sw1990 and panc-1 cells.
"to validate whether hmga1 is a direct target of mir-26a, we mutated the mir-26a binding site in the 3'utr of hmga1 and observed loss of repression."
"together, these results support the hypothesis that mcl-1 is a direct target of mir-193a-3p."
"these results together confirm that mcl-1 is a direct target of mir-193a-3p and that the region between 1,585 and 1,591 bp downstream of the stop codon is a targetsequence to which mir-193a-3p bind. in short, the overlap in phenotypes caused by either mcl-1 downregulation or expression of mir-193a-3p, strongly suggest that mcl-1 downregulation is a critical point in mir-193a-3p-induced apoptosis."
"together, these observations strongly suggest that mcl-1 downregulation is a critical step during apoptosis triggered by mir-193a-3p."
figue 6: chd5 was a direct target of mir-454.
ectopic expression of mir-454 inhibited the chd5 mrna and protein expression .
"the expression of mir-132 was negatively correlated with the protein expression levels of mecp2 and bdnf, whereas mecp2 expression was positively correlated with bdnf expression in the peripheral blood of patients with mdd."
"overexpression of mir-132 significantly reduced the expression levels of mecp2, at both the mrna and protein level, whereas downregulation of mir-132 increased the mrna and protein expression levels of mecp2."
"these results indicate that mecp2 and mir-132 may regulate hippocampal bdnf expression in an opposite manner, suggesting that homeostatic interactions between these factors control hippocampal bdnf expression."
"here we show post-transcriptional regulation of shank3 expression by three micrornas , mir-7, mir-34a, and mir-504."
"together, these results suggest that mir-7, mir-34a, and mir-504 directly bind to the shank3 3'utr and downregulate its expression."
"we found that mir-7, mir-34a, and mir-504, three mirnas with altered expression profiles in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, directly regulate shank3 expression."
a luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that mir-145 was able to bind to the 3'-untranslated region of fscn1 mrna.
"luciferase activity levels were significantly reduced in ags cells with the wild type 3'-utr of fscn1 mrna co-transfected with mir-145 mimics; however, luciferase activity levels did not change in ags cells with mutant type 3'-utr of fscn1 mrna co-transfected with mir-145 mimics, compared with the control group , indicating that fscn1 is a direct target gene of mir-145."
"therefore, the results suggest that mir-145 negatively regulates the protein expression of fscn1 in ags gastric carcinoma cells, perhaps by directly binding to the 3'-utr of fscn1 mrna."
"the present study identified fscn1 as a target of mir-145 in gastric carcinoma cells, and demonstrated that mir-145 was downregulated, whereas fscn1 was upregulated in gastric carcinoma cell lines, as compared with normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells."
"we presentcompelling evidence that tiam1, a guanidine exchange factor of the rac gtpase, is a direct target of both mir-21 and mir-31."
"thus mir-21 and mir-31 appear to control tiam1 expression mainly through repression of the protein translation, not degradation of the mrna."
"5, mir-21 and mir-31 also down-regulated tiam1 in dld1 and sw480 cells ."
"importantly, we found that transfection of mir-21 did not cause a significant change in mature mir-31 level, and vice versa ."
"therefore, mir-21 and mir-31 do not influence the expression levels of each other and likely impact the expression of tiam1 independently."
this strongly suggests that mir-31 also directly represses tiam1 translation.
these data further substantiate our model that repression of tiam1 is a critical component in mir-21/mir-31 regulation of migratory and invasive properties of lim 1863 cells.
the basal levels of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-w were high in bel-7402/5-fu cells and mir-195 overexpression repressed bcl-w protein level and inhibited the luciferase activity of a bcl-w 3'untranslated region-based reporter construct in both bel-7402/5-fu and bel-7402 cells.
"taken together, these data demonstrate that mir-371a-5p enhance bag3 protein expression, and that the interaction of mir-371a-5p with human bag3 3'-utr critically depends on the presence of the g2252 variant."
"intriguingly, this posttranscriptional pathway regulating bag3 protein expression is altered by the presence of the g2252c variant in the 3'-utr of human bag3, which is frequently present in a cohort of ttc patients, suggesting that epi-induced mir-371-5p and bag3 may potentially represent new molecular components in the disease pathogenesis of ttc."
"skeletal muscle-specific mir-486 overexpression in dmdmdx-5cv animals decreased levels of dock3, reduced pten expression, and subsequently increased levels of phosphorylated akt, which resulted in an overall beneficial effect."

these data indicated that sox9 was a direct target of mir-32 in nsclc.
"according to the data of mirtarbase, cdkn1a might be a candidate target gene of mir-96. in addition, luciferase reporter and western blot assays respectively demonstrated that mir-96 could bind to the putative seed region in cdkn1a mrna 3'utr, and significantly reduce the expression level of cdkn1a protein."
"taken together, these data demonstrated that mir-96 could negatively regulate the expression of cdkn1a in both bc cells and tissues."
"overexpression of mir-338-3p inhibited hif-1alpha 3'-utr luciferase activity and hif-1alpha protein levels in hepg2, smmc-7721, and huh7 cells."
we subsequently identified that akt1 was a target gene of mir-185.
re-expression of akt1 could partially rescue the inhibitory effects of mir-185 on the capacity of nsclc cell proliferation and motility.
these data suggest that mir-185 negatively regulates akt1 expression in nsclc cells.
"taken together, the cancer suppressor role of mir-185 in nsclc is at least partially by inhibiting its target gene akt1."
these data reveal that fgf-21 could be negatively regulated by mir-212 and/or under conditions of lipogenesis.
these data clearly indicate that fgf-21 is a target gene of mir-212 involved in lipogenesis.
forced over-expression of mir-23a/b decreased the level of fas protein.
"moreover, over-expression of fas rescued the pro-proliferation effect of mir-23, indicating fas is a direct mediator of mir-23 functions."
"furthermore, contrast to mir-23a/b which was up regulated, the fas expression level was down-regulated and inversely correlated with mir-23 in split radiation induced lymphoma tissue samples."
"finally, our data also indicates that mir-23a could repress fas much more potent than mir-23b and the additional region besides conserved seed pairing enables mir-23a's higher regulation.fig."
3 the predicted mir-23a/b binding site on murine fas mrna 3'utr and the mutation strategy is shown.
a dual luciferase assay of nih3t3 cells co-transfected with the firefly luciferase constructs containing the wild type or 258-264 mutated fas 3'-utr and mir-23a/b mimics or scrambled negative control .
mir-23a/b mimics inhibit endogenous fas expression in el4 cells as detected by facs assay.
mir-23a/b mimics inhibit endogenous fas expression in el4 cells as detected by qrt-pcr.
"we found that the mouseklhl1as rna is not spliced and terminates in a polyadenylation site in the klhl1 promoter region, whereas both the present and previous work show that human klhl1as is highly variably spliced into processed transcripts that contain up to six exons."
the evolutionary conservation of this antisense/sense transcriptional organization strongly indicates that klhl1as transcripts play a significant biological role in both human and mouse presumably as a regulator of klhl1 expression.
"as a result, foxm1 was a binding target of mir-370,overexpression of mir-370 in mg63 and u2os cells remarkably decreased the protein level of foxm1."
"next, we further demonstrated whether foxm1 was a direct target of mir-370 by using luciferase reporter assay."
"the results showed that overexpression of mir-370 significantly decreased the luciferase activity of pmir-foxm1 3'-utr wt, where as mutation of the mir-370-binding site in the foxm1 3'-utr abolished the effect of mir-370 ."
these results suggested that foxm1 was directly and negatively regulated by mir-370.
"cdc42, a mediator of the pi3k pathway, was identified as a novel mir-18a target."
"overexpression of mir-18a reduced cdc42 expression, and a luciferase assay confirmed that mir-18a directly targets the 3'utr of cdc42."
mir-18a mimics had a similar effect on proliferation as a small molecule inhibitor of cdc42.
"inhibition of cdc42 expression is likely to be a key mechanism by which mir-18a impairs cancer cell growth, with a target protector experiment revealing mir-18a influences proliferation via direct inhibition of cdc42."
inhibition of ccnd1 by mir-18a may also assist in this growth-suppression effect.
these results indicated that mir-351 reduced endothelial cell survival and suppressed angiogenesis through targeting stat3 in vitro.
we hypothesized that mir-124 and mir-506 may directly target dnmt3b and may indirectly target dnmt1.
the above results may preliminarily indicate that dnmt3b is a direct target and that dnmt1 is an indirect target of mir-124 and mir-506.

this study indicated that mir-323 might regulate ischemia/reperfusion-induced rat neuronal cell death via targeting bri3.
these results showed that mir-323 bound directly to a specific site in the 3'-utr of bri3 mrna .

"in the present study, we constructed a luciferase reporter system and identified hef1 as a direct target of mir-145."
"taken together, these findings indicate that hef1 promotes emt and bone invasion in prostate cancer by directly targeted by mir-145, and mir-145 suppresses emt and invasion, at least in part, through repressing hef1."
"thus, these observations indicated that mir-145 directly targeted hef1 through interacting with the 3'-utr."
p53 was a direct target of mir-300 in breast cancer cells.
genetic evidence obtained in the mouse confirmed the importance of satb2 regulation by mir-34b/c.
several lines of evidence verified that satb2 is a bona fide target of mir-34s.
these data provide an in vivo verification of the importance of satb2 regulation by mir-34b and -c in osteoblasts in vivo.
"the direct regulation of satb2 by mir-34s explains why these mirnas regulate osteocalcin, bsp, and possibly other genes whose expression is controlled by runx2 and satb2 or atf4 and satb2."
"although target mrnas frequently have multiple copies of mirna target sites in their 3'-utr , examination of the nocturnin mrna sequence revealed a single potential target sequence for mir-122 in its 3'-utr ."
"these results indicated that nocturnin is a potential direct target of mir-122, and mir-122 recognizes the putative recognition site present in the nocturnin 3'-utr."
"these data were consistent with previous reports that listed nocturnin mrna as one of a set of mrnas that were up-regulated by knocking down mir-122 in vivo , ."
"although overexpression of mir-122 did not affect the rna level of the nocturnin reporter gene , the knock down of mir-122 was able to significantly increase nocturnin mrna levels in mouse liver."
"our data thus demonstrate that this robustly rhythmic expression of nocturnin in liver is shaped, at least in part, by mir-122."
"these phenotypes are dependent on two of the mir-21 targets validated in this study, hnrpk and tap63."
phosphatase and tensin homolog was a direct target of mir-26a.

mir-21 and spry2 were expressed in the mm cell lines.
"in the rpmi 8226 and km3 cell lines, mir-21 was highly expressed and spry2 was expressed at a low level."
"however, in the u-266 cell line, in which a low level of mir-21 was detected, spry2 was expressed at a high level."
"western blot analysis revealed that in the mm cell lines with a high level of endogenous mir-21 expression, spry2 was expressed at a significantly lower level."
"by contrast, in the u-266 cell line with low endogenous mir-21 expression, spry2 was expressed at a significantly higher level ."
we investigated whether overexpression of mir-125a or mir-125b was sufficient to reduce eif4ebp1 levels in skov3 and ovcar-429 ovarian cancer cells.
treatment with an inhibitor of mir-125a or mir-125b enhanced eif4ebp1 mrna and protein levels.
"taken together, these results show that both mi mir-125a and mir-125b can directly influence eif4ebp1 through specific binding to its 3'-utr."
"hdac3 showed a positive feedback loop with mirnas such as mir-200b, mir-217, and mir-335."
"mir-200b, mir-217, and mir-335 negatively regulated the expression of mir-326 and the invasion and migration potential of cancer cells while enhancing the apoptotic effect of anti-cancer drugs."
"targetscan analysis predicted mir-200b and mir-217 as negative regulators of cancer-associated gene, a cancer/testis antigen, which is known to regulate the response to anti-cancer drugs."

figure 6 identification of mir-143 and mir-145 target.
3'utr luciferase reporter assay indicated that fascin homolog 1 could be co-regulated by mir-143 and mir-145.
luciferase reporter assay for 3'-utr of fscn1 regulated by mir-143 and mir-145.
co-transfection of mir-143 and mir-145 showed a synergistic effect on suppressing the expression of fscn1.
and our result also indicated that 3'-utr of fscn1 could be co-regulated by mir-143 and mir-145.
"with these researches, we suggested that mir-143 and mir-145 could control oncogenic fscn1 and take part in the modulation of metastases."
"col1a2 and vegf-a contained a conserved binding site of mir-29a in different species, suggesting that col1a2 and vegf-a were putative target genes."
"on performing a luciferase reporter assay, we showed that luciferase activity was significantly reduced in cells co-transfected with the wild-type col1a2 or vegf-a 3'-utr and increasing concentrations of mir-29a mimics."
"conversely, we found that mir-29a inhibitor significantly induced luciferase activity in cells transfected with wild-type col1a2 or vegf-a 3'-utr; after upregulation of mir-29a, the protein levels of col1a2 and vegf-a were notably reduced, while mir-29a knockdown led to significant upregulation of col1a2 and vegf-a protein levels ."
"these findings indicate that col1a2 and vegf-a are two direct targets of mir-29a, and the protein expression of col1a2 and vegf-a was negatively mediated by mir-29a in bj cells."
"rescue experiments indicated that the effects of plzf and mir-146a are mediated by mir-146a and cxcr4, respectively."
"our data indicate that megakaryopoiesis is controlled by a cascade pathway, in which plzf suppresses mir-146a transcription and thereby activates cxcr4 translation."
plzf is a transcriptional repressor of mir-146a expression.
mir-146a downregulates cxcr4 and impairs cell proliferation and differentiation/maturation.
luciferase-based promoter assays and plzf silencing studies indicate that the progressive increase in plzf expression during megakaryopoiesis represses mir-146a transcription.
"to demonstrate a direct interaction between mir-146a and cxcr4 mrna, we inserted the following constructs downstream of a renilla luciferase reporter cdna: 1 the full-length 3'-utr of cxcr4 mrna ."
"muts2 or muts3 reporter vector was not affected, , indicating that mir-146a interferes with cxcr4 mrna translation through a direct interaction with s2 and s3 sites in the 3'-utr-fl."
"we identified manganese superoxide dismutase messenger rna as a direct target of mir-212, and observed an inverse correlation between the level of mir-212 and mnsod protein in colorectal tumor samples."
"mnsod was identified as a novel major target of mir-212, which appears to play an important role in regulating emt via mnsod."
"taken together, these results suggest that mnsod is a direct target of mir-212 and the 3' utr of mnsod is the functional target site for mir-212. in this study, we determined that mir-212 regulates the metastasis and emt of crc by targeting mnsod."
tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 is a proapoptotic stress-induced p53 target gene.
"tp53inp1 expression is repressed by the oncogenic micro rna mir-155, which is overexpressed in pdac cells."
"the expression of the previously reported putative gene targets of mmu-mir-466h-5p, smo, stat5a, dad1, birc6, and bcl2l2 in anti-mir-466h and negative control cho cells is shown in figure 5. the mrna levels of smo, stat5a, dad1, birc6, and bcl2l2 genes were not significantly changed at 192 hours in the negative control cho cells compared to anti-mir-466h cho cells , but were significantly reduced at 216, 226, and 236 hours of cell culture."
"it is, therefore, likely that the inhibition of the activated mmu-mir-466h-5p in anti-mir-466h cho cells shown in figure 4 leads to increased levels of the anti-apoptotic genes: smo, stat5a, dad1, birc6, and bcl2l2 as seen in figure 5 which delays the activation of caspase-3/7 and onset of apoptotic cascade shown in figure 3."
these results confirm that smad4 gene is a mir-224 target mir-224 regulates smad4 gene expression at the posttranscriptional level .
these results further suggest that smad4 is a target of mir-224 and mediates the roles of mir-224 to influence gc proliferation and function.
"microrna-100 was predicted to target plk1 mrna, which was indeed under-expressed in c666-1 cells; inversely correlating with plk1 expression."
"using luciferase constructs containing the 3'-utr of plk1 sequence, we document that mir-100 can directly target plk1."
"hence, our data demonstrate for the first time, that under-expressed mir-100 leads to plk1 over-expression, which in turn, contributes to npc progression."
"to associate the mir-223 up-regulation with the down-regulated igf-1r, and to confirm the targeted inhibition of igf-1r by mir-223 in mc3t3-e1 cells, we then investigated the regulation by mir-223 up-regulation on the igf-1r expression in mc3t3-e1 cells."
we confirmed the targeting inhibition of igf-1r expression by mir-223 in mc3t3-e1 cells.
"pathways involving metabolic processes, terpenoid and sterol metabolism were selectively affected by concomitant regulation by mirnas and mrnas, and srebf1 was validated as a target of mir-21."
messengerrna levels of srebf1 increased by about 30% after mir-21 knock-down .
also srebp1 protein levels increased approximately 50% after mir-21 knock-down compared with a lna-scr .
"these data were consistent with srebf1 being a targetgene of mir-21. in summary, out of the three tested target, srebf1 was conclusively found to be a functional target of mir-21."
"the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 was verified as a mir-539 target gene using dual-luciferase reporter assays, quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting and was involved in mir-539-regulated npc cell growth."
"in hek293 cells cotransfected with the reporter plasmids and mir-539 mimic or nc duplex, the luciferase activity of the reporter that contained wild-type 3'-utr was significantly suppressed by mir-539 mimic, but the luciferase activity of mutant reporter was unaffected , indicating that mir-539 may suppress gene expression through mir-539 binding sequence at the 3'-utr of cdk4."
"together, the results show that mir-539 could regulate the expression of endogenous human cdk4 by directly targeting the 3'-utr of cdk4 mrna, and human cdk4 is a new target of mir-539."
"this effect is mediated trough mir-146b-5p, which inhibits il-6 expression through a specific sequence at the il-6 3'-utr."
these results indicate that mir-146b-5p represses il-6 expression in breast stromal fibroblasts.
this demonstrates that the mir-146b-5p-dependent repression of il-6 is mediated through binding to its seeding sequence in the il-6 3'-utr.
"we have recently shown that p16 is a positive regulator of mir-146b-5p , and the present data indicate that this microrna inhibits il-6, whose mrna contains a specific mir-146b-5p binding site in its 3' utr."
ndst1 was a direct targetgene of mir-191.
ndst1 expression level was inversely correlated with mir-191.
"these findings suggested that mir-191 could directly bindto the 3'-utr of ndst1, supporting that ndst1 was a direct targetgene of mir-191."
"as a result, we found that the endogenous ndst1 also showed opposite trend to the mir-191 level, both on mrna level and protein level ."
"these data indicated that mir-191 could negatively regulate the endogenous ndst1 expression in mgc803 cells, supporting that ndst1 was a direct target gene of mir-191."
these results indicate that mir-101 functions to directly suppress dusp1 gene expression through the mir-101-binding sequence located at the 3'-utr of the dusp1 mrna.
"among several candidate target genes of mir- 340, we chose myo10 as the object of further study."

"akt1, cyclind1, mmp-2, mmp-9 and bcl-2 protein expression decreased, and p27 expression increased in a dose-dependent manner with mir-451 mimics oligonucleotides."
we computationally and experimentally validated that metastasis suppressor 1 is a direct mir-23a target and similarly validated that the ubiquitin ligase fbxw7 is a direct mir-27a target.
"similarly, we show that metastasis suppressor 1 is a direct mir-23a target; mtss1 interacts directly with cortactin to promote fi lopodia formation and upregulates src signaling ."
"functionally, our studies show that mtss1 is an important direct target for mir-23a and that reduced mtss1 levels accelerate mechanisms that promote colorectal cancer migration."
fscn1 was identified as a direct target of mir-145 and mir-133a.
mir-145 and mir-133a directly target fscn1.
mir-145 and mir-133a negatively regulated the protein expression of fscn1 in hcc cells
"furthermore, our results showed that mir-100 directly inhibited the expression of fzd-8 and inactivated the wnt/-beta-catenin pathway in breast cancer cells."
"ourfindings suggested that fzd-8 was a direct target of mir-100. in our studies, we found that mir-100 inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by targeting fzd-8 and inhibiting the wnt/-beta-catenin signaling pathway."
"from the above results, cx43 is one of the target genes of mir-20a and is repressed by mir-20a"
"to determine whether mir-133b directly targets egfr in crc cells, a luciferase assay was performed."
"the results showed that mir- 133b significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of the reporter gene, containing the 3'utr of egfr compared with the controls."
rt-qpcr analysis demonstrated that an sincreased expression of mir- 133b significantly decreased the mrna expression levels of egfr compared with the cells transfected with the control .
"taken together, these results confirmed that mir- 133b directly targeted egfr and repressed its expression levels in crc cells."
"further study revealed that mir-218, which was underexpressed in lung carcinoma, was predicted to bind the 3'-untranslated region of mef2d mrna."
mir-218 was shown to suppress the activity of luciferase with mef2d 3'-utr.
the changes in mir-218 levels affected the expression of mef2d in lung cancer cells and normal fibroblast cells.
there is also an inverse association between mir-218 abundance and mef2d levels in the lung carcinoma specimen.
the above findings indicated that mef2d is an authentic target of tumor suppressor mir-218.
micf binds to 5'-utr of the ompf transcript and represses production of ompf in response to environmental and/or stress conditions.
approximately one-third of the micf rna sequence participates in micf rna/ompf rna duplex formation and shields the shine-dalgarno sequence and aug translation start site on the message.
"microrna-18a upregulates autophagy and ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene expression in hct116 colon cancer cells.results of the present study pertaining to the role of mir-18a in regulating autophagy and atm gene expression in colon cancer cells revealed a novel function for mir-18a in a critical cellular event and on a crucial gene with significant impacts in cancer development, progression, treatment and in other diseases."
a database search revealed the predicted mirnas that target the catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme tert .
"among the 6 mirnas identified from the database search, 5-namely, mir-138, mir-491-5p, mir-3687, mir1207-5p, and mir-3065-3p howed differential expression in our study."
"only 2 of these, mir-3687 and mir-1207-5p , were changed by at least 2-fold."
"in the selected 12 hg-psc tissues with hmga2 overexpression, significant downregulation of mir-29b expression was evident compared with expression in matched normal ovarian tissues ."
a significant inverse correlation of hmga2 and mir-29b expression was noted .
mir-33a precursors significantly decreased smad7 mrna and protein expression when compared to their expression in cells transfected with the negative control mirna precursors.
